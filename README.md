# python-mini-projects
These are a series of projects I've followed to try and learn Python as a personal project. I've taken a half dozen courses on Python before but this is the first time I've used Git to track my work so I'm not a complete beginner.

# Implementation
Other than following along with the documentation or video's, there most likely won't be any special setup.

## Projects I've followed in the order that I went through them...

# Future Steps
I don't know how in-depth my curiosity will go with Python but I'll be on the look out for 5 minute to 1-7 day courses.
