# python-mini-projects
These are a series of projects I've followed to try and learn Python as a personal project. I've taken a half dozen courses on Python before but this is the first time I've used Git to track my work so I'm not a complete beginner.

# Implementation
Other than following along with the documentation or video's, there most likely won't be any special setup.

## Projects I've followed in the order that I went through them...

**1. Drum Machine with Python and Pygame** â€“ Full Project Course (2h 48m)  
Path: py_drum_machine  
Source: https://youtu.be/F3J3PZj0zi0  
Sounds: https://hiphopmakers.com/40-free-music-producer-free-drum-kits (Used Free 808 Drum Kit)  

**2. Python Data Analysis - LinkedIn Learning**  
Author/Instructor: Michele Vallisneri  
Path: lil-pda  
Notes: I'm not sure I'll make it through this course. The instructor uses Jupyter notebooks and all the exercise files were taken from there. I'm going to try and use a regular IDE and committing my code to Git as I follow along. Here goes nothing.  
Update: I figured out how to make my editor work with Jupyter notebooks without using Anaconda by downloading the Jupyter extension.

**3. Misc scripts**  
Path: misc  
Notes: I want to learn various ways to do some automation at work so I'll be creating some python files and using Google to figure out some solutions.
    1. copy-rename.py - I know this has to be easy but it's my first Python learning experience trying to accomplish this task to take a file, copy it and then rename the copy with a timestamp. This SO source provided what looks like a quick way to do this...

# Future Steps  
I don't know how in-depth my curiosity will go with Python but I'll be on the look out for 5 minute to 1-7 day courses.
